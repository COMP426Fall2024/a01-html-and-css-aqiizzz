        <p>Let's explore the THREE major turning points in Sun Wukong's life.</p>
        <ol>
             <li>
                <h2>Birth of Sun Wukong</h2>
                <img src="image/kingbirth.jpg" alt="The kingbirth">
                <p>
                    Sun Wukong's story begins on the mystical Flower-Fruit Mountain, where he was born from a stone infused with the primal energies of the earth and sky. 
                    Showing intelligence and independence from an early age, he quickly became the king of the monkeys. Dissatisfied with mortality, 
                    he sought immortality through various masters, learning shape-shifting, martial arts, and magical powers, eventually mastering 72 transformations that allowed him to take any form.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Havoc in Heaven</h2>
                <img src="image/havoc.png" alt="The havoc">
                <p>
                    Sun Wukong’s rebellious nature led him to challenge the heavens themselves. He infiltrated the celestial court, disrupted the order of gods, and declared himself the “Great Sage Equal to Heaven” (齐天大圣). 
                    Armed with his magical staff, the Ruyi Jingu Bang, which could change size at his command, Sun Wukong defeated heavenly armies, causing chaos among the gods and immortals. 
                    However, his pride and defiance ultimately led to his capture by Buddha, who imprisoned him under a mountain for 500 years.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Pilgrimage to the West for Buddhist Sutra</h2>
                 <img src="image/west.jpg" alt="Go to the West">
                <p>
                    Sun Wukong’s true transformation comes when he is released by the Bodhisattva Guanyin and assigned to protect the Buddhist monk Xuanzang on his pilgrimage to retrieve sacred scriptures from India. 
                    This journey is the heart of Journey to the West, where Sun Wukong undergoes both physical and spiritual challenges, fighting demons, monsters, and supernatural forces, 
                    while slowly learning the virtues of loyalty, humility, and restraint.
